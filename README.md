# Optical-Character-Recognition-OCR-

This is my first project ever using Pyton, I completed this one on April 2022, that time I was starting to learn Object Oriented Programming.

This was my final project for Python 3 Specialization. The code is full from scratch. Unfortunately my file is 666 MB so I cannot upload all the resources I used to make it full working, due to size restrictions.

So I just added the code files:

The objective of the program is the following: You upload a zip archive containing the scanned pages of a magazine. Your input is the name of a person. The program looks for the name on each page of the archive, if it finds the name in a specific page, the program looks for all faces that are present in the page and print the number of the page and the faces. The program goes through all the pages in the file.

Archive: project-Copy2-Mark.ipynb Contains the big project. It takes 30 minutes to run though. 

Archive: project-Christopher.ipynb This runs a smaller version of the archive, it takes 5 minutes to run.
